# DDEV Agents Add-on

Standardized environment for creating an isolated workspace where agentic AI tools can be run safely and consistently across Wunder.io projects.

## Overview

The `ddev-agents` add-on provides a pre-configured `agents` service and VS Code Dev Container settings. Key benefits include:

1.  **Host Isolation**: AI agents run in a dedicated, isolated container. This protects your host machine from potentially errant scripts or external packages executed by AI tools.
2.  **Standardization**: Every project uses the same high-quality, pre-configured environment.
3.  **Maintainability**: Improvements and security updates are pushed centrally through the add-on.

## Workflow & Security

-   **Git Operations**: All Git operations (`commit`, `push`, `pull`) should be performed on your **host machine**. The container provides access to the code, but you should use your host's Git configuration and SSH keys for repository management.
-   **Credential Safety**: ⚠️ **NEVER put any credentials, API keys, or secrets inside the devcontainer.** Always use environment variables or DDEV's built-in secret management to pass necessary keys to the container without storing them in the image or container filesystem.

## Installation

To install the add-on in your DDEV project, run:

```bash
ddev addon get wunderio/ddev-agents
ddev restart
```

## Supported Environments

This add-on is specifically designed and supported for:

-   **VS Code** (Primary interface)
-   **Jetbrains IDEs** (PhpStorm, WebStorm etc.)
-   **Antigravity** (AI Coding Assistant)
-   **Claude Code** (CLI — via `ddev claude`)
-   **GitHub Copilot CLI** (CLI — via `ddev copilot`)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Connection Check
**Always verify that your IDE is connected to the Dev Container before running any AI agents.** 

If you run agents while still on your host machine, you lose the safety of the isolated environment, and scripts will have direct access to your local system. Look for the "Dev Container: Agents" indicator in the bottom-left corner of VS Code (or your editor's equivalent) before proceeding.

### 1. Start DDEV
Before opening the devcontainer, ensure your DDEV project is running:
```bash
ddev start
```

### 2. Install required plugins
1. For PhpStorm: install the "Dev Containers" plugin:

- Navigate to "Settings → Plugins", enable "Dev Containers" and its dependencies, and restart the IDE


### 3. Open in Editor
1.  Open your project in **VS Code** or **PhpStorm**.
2.  When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**
3.  IDE will be relaunched in `agents` container, providing a terminal with all necessary tools pre-installed and running all IDE AI requests inside the container with only access to files inside the `workspace`.

If you don't get the popup you can manually launch the project inside devcontainer:
In VSCode use the Command Palette (< ctrl >-< shift >-p): `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
In PhpStorm:
- Navigate to: "Menu bar → Tools → Services → Dev Containers → Show Dev Containers"
- If there isn't any, click "New Dev Container" under the "Dev Containers" sidebar item
- Under "From Local Project", use the default settings, and from the "Path to devcontainer.json", select "Specify Path" and the path of your project's devcontainer.json (for example: /Users/myuser/Sites/myproject/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)


## Features

-   **Isolated Python Environment**: Based on `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3-bookworm`.
-   **Integrated Tools**: Pre-installed Node.js, GH CLI, Git and common utilities.
-   **Dynamic Versions**: PHP and Node.js versions are read from `.ddev/config.yaml` and injected at build time.
-   **SSH-Based Tool Execution**: MCP tools execute commands in the DDEV web container via SSH (no Docker socket access).
-   **MCP Tool Configs**: Pre-configured tools for Drush, Composer, Drupal MCP proxy, and log access (`.agents/tools-config/`).
-   **GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode)**: Includes the `copilot` CLI extension.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Uses your host's `DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN` automatically, so you never have to type credentials inside the container.

## Architecture

The agents container communicates with the DDEV web container via SSH:

-   **Ephemeral SSH Keys**: Ed25519 keypair generated fresh on every `ddev start`, distributed via `docker exec`
-   **Automatic User Detection**: The DDEV user is detected from `/var/www/html` ownership in the web container
-   **No Docker Socket**: The agents container has no access to the Docker daemon — all command execution goes through SSH
-   **Security Hardened**: All Linux capabilities dropped, privilege escalation disabled

### MCP Tools

The `.agents/tools-config/` directory contains YAML definitions for tools exposed via the [wdrmcp](https://github.com/wunderio/wdrmcp) MCP server:

-   **Drush**: Site management, cache rebuild, site install, PHP eval, watchdog logs
-   **Composer**: Install, update, require dependencies
-   **Logs**: Nginx access/error logs, PHP-FPM logs
-   **Drupal MCP**: Proxy to Drupal's built-in MCP server endpoint

See `.agents/README.md` for details on adding custom tools and configuring credentials.

## Claude Code (Teams) — CLI

Run Claude Code directly from your host terminal via `ddev claude`, with all execution happening inside the isolated agents container.

### Prerequisites

-   A **Claude for Teams** account (centrally billed seats — no personal API keys needed)
-   DDEV project with the `ddev-agents` add-on installed

### First-Time Setup

1.  Start the DDEV project:
    ```bash
    ddev start
    ```
2.  Install and authenticate (first run auto-installs Claude Code):
    ```bash
    ddev claude login
    ```
    Sign in with your company Claude for Teams account when prompted.
3.  Verify authentication:
    ```bash
    ddev claude
    ```
    Inside the Claude REPL, run `/status` to confirm the auth method shows **Teams** (not API key).

### Usage

**Interactive mode** (REPL):
```bash
ddev claude
```

**Headless mode** (single prompt):
```bash
ddev claude -p "explain what this module does"
```

**Pass any Claude Code flags**:
```bash
ddev claude --version
ddev claude --help
```

### How Auth Persistence Works

-   Claude Code auth state is stored in a Docker volume (`ddev-agents-claude-state`)
-   This volume uses a fixed name, so auth is **shared across all DDEV projects** on the same machine
-   Auth survives container rebuilds (`ddev restart`) — you only need to log in once
-   PHP, Composer, and Claude Code are installed via devcontainer features during `ddev build-devcontainer`
-   The Claude Code binary is baked into the image — run `ddev build-devcontainer` to update it

### Security

-   **No API keys**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is explicitly blanked in the container to ensure Teams OAuth is used
-   **Bypass-permissions disabled**: Managed settings (`claude-managed-settings.json`) are mounted read-only into the container
-   **Container isolation**: Claude runs inside the agents container with all security hardening (no capabilities, no privilege escalation)

### Resetting Claude State

To clear all auth and configuration data:
```bash
docker volume rm ddev-agents-claude-state
```
Then run `ddev claude login` again to re-authenticate.

### Troubleshooting

**`ddev claude login` fails or hangs:**
> The OAuth login flow may require a browser-accessible redirect. If the default flow doesn't work inside the container, try:
> ```bash
> ddev claude login --method email-code
> ```
> This uses an email verification code instead of a browser redirect.

**`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` warning on host:**
> If you have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your host environment, it will **not** leak into the container (it's explicitly blanked). However, running `claude` directly on your host (outside DDEV) would use that key and incur API billing instead of Teams subscription.

## GitHub Copilot CLI — CLI

Run GitHub Copilot CLI directly from your host terminal via `ddev copilot`, with all execution happening inside the isolated agents container.

### Prerequisites

-   An active **GitHub Copilot subscription** (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
-   DDEV project with the `ddev-agents` add-on installed
-   GitHub token set up (see [GitHub Authentication](#github-authentication-recommended-setup))
-   **devcontainer CLI** on your host machine (see [Installing the devcontainer CLI](#installing-the-devcontainer-cli))

### First-Time Setup

1.  Start the DDEV project:
    ```bash
    ddev start
    ```
2.  Ensure you have `DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN` set on your host (see GitHub Authentication section).
3.  Run Copilot CLI:
    ```bash
    ddev copilot
    ```
    The CLI will automatically authenticate using your GitHub token.
4.  Verify by running `/status` in the Copilot REPL.

### Usage

**Interactive mode** (REPL):
```bash
ddev copilot
```

**Headless mode** (single prompt):
```bash
ddev copilot -p "explain what this function does"
```

**Pass any Copilot CLI flags**:
```bash
ddev copilot --version
ddev copilot --help
```

### How It Works

-   **devcontainer CLI**: `ddev copilot` uses `devcontainer exec --container-id` to run inside the DDEV-managed container. `--container-id` bypasses devcontainer's own container-discovery (which only finds containers started via `devcontainer up`), while still reading `devcontainer.json` to inject `remoteEnv` — including `GH_TOKEN` from your host's `DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN`
-   **Pre-installed**: Copilot CLI is installed via devcontainer feature during container build
-   **Persistent state**: Configuration is stored in a Docker volume (`ddev-${DDEV_PROJECT}-copilot-state`)
-   **Project-specific state**: Each DDEV project has its own isolated configuration volume
-   **State survives rebuilds**: Configuration survives container rebuilds (`ddev restart`)
-   **Authentication**: Uses the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable injected via devcontainer CLI from your host's `DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN`
-   **Always up-to-date**: Copilot CLI is reinstalled during container rebuilds to ensure latest version

### Installing the devcontainer CLI

`ddev copilot` requires the [devcontainer CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) on your host machine. The command will attempt to auto-install it via `npm` on first run, or fall back to `npx` — but for the fastest startup, install it once globally:

**npm (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

**Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew install devcontainer
```

**Winget (Windows):**
```bash
winget install Microsoft.DevContainerCLI
```

> If you have Node.js / npm but not the CLI, `ddev copilot` will install it automatically on the first run. If `npx` is available but not `npm`, it will use `npx` as a one-shot runner (slower on first invocation). If none of these are present, the command exits with clear instructions.

### Security

-   **Token-based auth**: Uses your GitHub token from the host environment (never stored in the container)
-   **Managed configuration**: Security restrictions (`copilot-managed-config.json`) are mounted read-only into the container
-   **Container isolation**: Copilot runs inside the agents container with all security hardening (no capabilities, no privilege escalation)
-   **Denied operations**: Git destructive operations, publishing packages, SSH access, and reading sensitive files are blocked

### Resetting Copilot State

To clear all configuration data for the current project:
```bash
# Replace ${DDEV_PROJECT} with your project name (from .ddev/config.yaml)
docker volume rm ddev-${DDEV_PROJECT}-copilot-state
```
Copilot will re-initialize on the next run.

### Troubleshooting

**Authentication fails:**
> Ensure `DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN` is set on your host and includes "Copilot Requests: Read-only" permission. Restart your terminal and run `ddev restart` after setting the token.

## GitHub Authentication (Recommended Setup)

To use GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode) or `gh` commands without repetitive logins, set up a Personal Access Token (PAT) on your **host machine**.

### 1. Generate a GitHub Token
1.  Go to [GitHub Fine-grained Tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
2.  **Name & Expiration**: Set a name (e.g., "Copilot CLI Local") and a reasonable expiration (max 366 days).
3.  **Repository Access**: Select **Public Repositories (read-only)** or **Only select repositories** (even if you select none). The CLI works on local files and doesn't need to see your remote repos.
4.  **Account Permissions**:
    -   Find the **Copilot Requests** dropdown.
    -   Select **Access: Read-only**.
5.  Generate and copy the token.

### 2. Configure your Host Machine
Add the token to your shell profile so it's always available when you start the devcontainer.

**For macOS (Zsh or Bash):**
1.  Open your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`):
    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
2.  Add this line at the end:
    ```bash
    export DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ```
3.  Save and restart your terminal (or run `source ~/.zshrc`).

**For Linux/Ubuntu:**
1.  Run 
    ```bash
    systemctl --user edit --full --force environment.d/myenv.conf`
    ```
2.  Add line:
    ```bash
    DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ```
3.  Save and run
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    ```


### 3. Benefits
-   **Zero-Interaction**: The devcontainer automatically picks up host's `$DDEV_AGENTS_GH_TOKEN` and uses it as `$GH_TOKEN` inside the container, then configures the `gh-copilot` extension.
-   **Security**: No credentials are ever typed or stored inside the container's history/filesystem. 

## Centralized Development

The purpose of this repository is to serve as the single source of truth for our agentic workflows. By using `ddev addon get`, projects can stay up-to-date with our latest agent configurations by simply running `ddev addon get wunderio/ddev-agents` again.

## Troubleshooting

*General:*

Container (re)build fails with the following error message:
```
W: GPG error: [https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) stable InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 62D54FD4003F6525
E: The repository '[https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) stable InRelease' is not signed.
ERROR: Feature "Common Utilities" (ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils) failed to install!
```
> There was an issue in earlier versions of devcontainer with expired Yarn GPG keys. This has already been fixed upstream, but if you are still getting the erro you probably have those older images cached on your local machine.
To fix the issue you need to remove the old images from your system by running the following commands:
`docker images -a` <- find the devcontainer image id
`docker rmi mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3-bookworm`

**sudo not working inside the container:**
> `sudo` is intentionally disabled via `no-new-privileges` for security hardening.
> If you need root access, run from your host terminal:
> `ddev ssh -s agents -u root`

**Troubleshooting for macOS**:

$GH_TOKEN is not recognized after rebuilding
> Try launching VS Code directly from your terminal by running `code .` in your project folder. This ensures VS Code inherits your shell's environment variables.

**Troubleshooting for Linux/Ubuntu:**

If you get error `ERROR: unable to prepare context: path "/tmp/devcontainercli-something/empty-folder" not found` 
>Make sure you don't have Docker installed as a snap package. If it is, remove the snap and install Docker the traditional way

(PhpStorm) If you get error `ERROR [stage-0 4/7] RUN chmod -R 0755 /tmp/jb-devcontainer-features/ghcr.io-devcontainers-features-node-1 && cd /tmp/jb-devcontainer-features/ghcr.io-devcontainers-features-node-1 && chmod +x ./devconta  40.6s`
>You need to add
> ```bash
>    {
>      "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4", "1.1.1.1"]
>    }
>    ```
>    Into your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and restart docker (`sudo systemctl restart docker`)
